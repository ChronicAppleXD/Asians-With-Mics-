                        This podcast was started by two guys who just wanted to have fun but quickly went no where.
                        Despite that they still do their podcast because podcasting is fun and no one needs a reason
                        to do it.

                Never have I ever imagined for it to have a website and to not grow as big as it did.
                It certainly didn't take me by surprise. All I know is that I am looking forward to the future
                of the podcast!"
